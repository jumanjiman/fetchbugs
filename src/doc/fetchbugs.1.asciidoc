announces its network activities on stderr.

-v 'version'::
Restrict bugs to a specific 'version' of 'product'.
Omitting this option retrieves bugs for every 'version' of 'product'. 
To use this option effectively, you must know the 
case-sensitive versions of 'product'
for the target Bugzilla instance.

-u 'URI'::
The 'URI' of the Bugzilla instance. This option overrides the 
'BZ_URI' environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
BZ_URI::
The 'URI' for the Bugzilla instance.


HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY::
Set these environment variables as appropriate to reach the Internet.

BROWSER::
